# Smoking Simulation

Smoking Simulation is an app to simulate the spreading of smokers and non-smokers, their interactions and population during certain amount of time.


## Description

The application allows users to observe simulation of spreading smokers and their behavior among given population parameters (3 different cases provided). Simulation rules and scenarios are based on real-life researches on smokers in the USA, EU and Ukraine. After closing the simulation window, users can inspect 4 different plots showing the amount of smokers in different age categories during the period of simulation.

The main engine of the project is finite state machine algorithms that run the logical part of the application. All the visuals are provided with Python libraries Matplotlib and Seaborn. 

## Visuals

The simulation process looks like this:


When the simulation is over, you can watch statistics plots representing data collected during simulation


## Usage

To run the application, clone this repository locally and run the main module:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
